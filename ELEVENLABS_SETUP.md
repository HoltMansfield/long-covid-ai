# ElevenLabs Setup Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Create Your ElevenLabs Agent

1. Go to [ElevenLabs Agents Platform](https://elevenlabs.io/app/conversational-ai)
2. Click "Create Agent"
3. Configure your agent:

#### **System Prompt** (for Long COVID Crash Interview):
```
You are a compassionate AI assistant helping people with Long COVID document their crash experiences. 

Your role is to:
1. Conduct a gentle, empathetic interview about their crash
2. Ask about severity (1-10 scale)
3. Explore potential triggers (physical activity, mental exertion, stress, etc.)
4. Document symptoms and their impact
5. Understand the timeline and recovery

Be patient, understanding, and never rush the conversation. People with Long COVID often have brain fog and fatigue, so:
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Allow pauses for them to think
- Offer to repeat or clarify
- Validate their experiences
- Never minimize their symptoms

Start by asking: "Can you tell me about a recent crash you experienced? On a scale of 1-10, how severe was it?"
```

#### **Voice Selection**:
- Choose a warm, empathetic voice
- Recommended: "Rachel" or "Bella" for female, "Adam" or "Antoni" for male
- Test different voices to find the most comforting one

#### **Settings**:
- **Language**: English
- **Turn-taking**: Enabled (allows natural interruptions)
- **Response time**: Balanced (not too fast, not too slow)

### 2. Get Your Agent ID

After creating your agent:
1. Click on your agent
2. Look for the **Agent ID** in the settings
3. Copy it (format: `agent_xxxxxxxxxx`)

### 3. Update Environment Variables

Add to your `.env.local`:
```bash
# ElevenLabs Conversational AI
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk_535c44f6bf1d2832398205c1dbeb02b7f6c17310494afe44
ELEVENLABS_AGENT_ID=your_agent_id_here
```
